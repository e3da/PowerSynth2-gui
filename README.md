# PowerSynth 2 Release Series Core Repository
## Repository Overview
This is the gui repository for PowerSynth 2. Refer to the [PowerSynth2-core](https://github.com/e3da/PowerSynth2-core) and other related repos for the CLI and other parts. 
This repository contains the main source code for the QT-based PowerSynth 2 the GUI. 

The UI is designed with QT designer. Currently, Qt 5.15 and PySide2 are used for the release.
Note that the GUI is not tested extensively as the CLI. Minor rendering issues exists, especially on Windows. Also, several modules are ported from earilier versions. Therefore, it is provided for users' convienience and preview. Regular users and researchers are suggested to use CLI for more stable and smoother work flow. 

# PowerSynth 2 Project Overview
PowerSynth 2 started as a research project to introduce the VLSI electronics design automation algorithms for power electronic applications. It is developed originally by the [E3DA Lab](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/) as a POETS project and then jointly by [MSCAD Lab](https://mscad.uark.edu/), at University of Arkansas. 

PowerSynth 2 was first developed as an enhanced layout engine for PowerSynth 1 to handle design constraints in complicated layouts with efficiency improvements. The new layout engine is first previewed in PowerSynth v1.3, and then became the sole engine in v1.9. In addition, new 3D layout algorithms, electrical/thermal models, and optimization algorithms are introduced in v2.0.

The PowerSynth 2 project is co-directed by [Prof. Yarui Peng](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/yrpeng/name/Yarui+Peng/) and [Prof. Alan Mantooth](https://engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/mantooth/name/Alan+Mantooth/). The research project is mainly supported by NSF through POETS ERC, and ARL through a series of grants. 

The main developers of this release series include Imam Al Razi, Quang Le, and Tristan Evans. The initial GUI is mainly developed by Joshua Mitchener as an REU project. The codebase also received contributions from many collaborators, graduates, and undergrads.

The main features, algorithms, and experiments of PowerSynth 2 are summarized in the following papers:

* v2.0: Imam Al Razi, Quang Le, Tristan Evans, H. Alan Mantooth, and Yarui Peng, ["PowerSynth 2: Physical Design Automation for High-Density 3D Multi-Chip Power Modules"](https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2022.3227300), IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, vol. 38, no. 4, pp. 4698-4713, April 2023.

There are many other ongoing research projects to enhance its capabilities. But the feature may or may not be included in the release version yet. Several papers describing the models, simulation, and optimization results include:

PowerSynth 2 is still under active development, and we are actively recruiting new students to join our team. Given the nature of the research, our priority is to explore new design methodologies and knowledge on Electronic Design Automation for Power Electronics. Our current work includes extending PowerSynth from power module to converter designs with reliability optimizations. For more details about the PowerSynth project and software download, please refer to the [PowerSynth Release Website](https://e3da.csce.uark.edu/release/PowerSynth/) with publications, demos, and presentations. 

We welcome contributions and collaborations from the community by providing patches and reporting issues. If you find our research projects helpful, please attribute this work in your publications and presentations as appropriate.
